# The Immersive Music Mod

# ANNOUNCEMENT
I am no longer developing for The Immersive Music Mod. For anyone who wishes to continue development for the project, feel free to dm me on discord `@tape_os` with any questions you may have about the codebase.

## Download:
https://modrinth.com/mod/immersivemusicmod

Old versions can be found at:
https://github.com/Tape-Dispenser/Immersive-Music-Mod/releases

## Installation:
1. Download and install fabric 1.20.4 https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install
2. Download .jar file from the link above
3. Download latest fabric api for your selected version https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/releases
4. Move both mod and fabric api to your mods folder

## Usage:
### Commands:
* `/skip [song name]` : skips to the next song, if no song name is provided the mod will pick a song
* `/timmstop`, `/stp` : stops currently playing song, a new song will play after allotted delay time
* `/nowplaying`, `/np` : displays currently playing song in chat
* `/cfg` : opens config menu

## Building from source:
1. Navigate to your desired build directory in a command line
2. `git clone https://github.com/Tape-Dispenser/Immersive-Music-Mod`
3. `cd ./Immersive-Music-Mod`
4. `./gradlew genSources`
5. `./gradlew build`

The compiled mod will be output to `The-Immersive-Music-Mod/build/libs`.
Make sure you put `TIMM_version.jar` in your mods folder and not `TIMM_version-sources.jar`!
